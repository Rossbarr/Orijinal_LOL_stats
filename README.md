# Orijinal_LOL_stats
Random Statistics about League of Legends stemming from queries I had about the game.

TO-DO: Create better documentation

This repository just showcases some of the code I created when I wondered about certain statistics. 

For example, if you're familiar with League of Legends, it compares the gold value of using one rune page vs another (as best it can).

For those that aren't familiar with League of Legends, this repository essentially does a cost-benefit analysis of certain choices that can be made in the game.

Each file in this top level directory originally set out to answer one question (though they may have been modified over time to answer other questions)

The statistics used were taken from Riot Games' API dedicated to LOL stats.

The data I use can be found in the /data/ folder. Top level modules are in the /modules/ folder. Figures should be saved to the /figures/ folder.
