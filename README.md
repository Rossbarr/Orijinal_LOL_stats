# Orijinal_LOL_stats
Random Statistics about League of Legends stemming from queries I had about the game.

TO-DO: Organize files
TO-DO: Create better documentation
TO-DO: reduce reused code into one localized file

This repository just showcases some of the code I created when I wondered about certain statistics. 

For example, if you're familiar with League of Legends, it compares the gold value of using one rune page vs another (as best it can).

For those that aren't familiar with League of Legends, this repository essentially does a cost-benefit analysis of certain choices that can be made in the game.

The files and questions they answer are scattered at best as most files were created in a day. The statistics used were taken from Riot Games' API dedicated to LOL stats.
